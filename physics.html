                    <h3>Thermodynamics lecture on different thermal processes</h3>
                    <p>This was a lecture that focused on different thermal processes, which are combinations of heat flow and work that result in changes in internal energy. Such as isothermal, adiabatic, isobaric, and isochoric.</p>
